# Gift-Genie-React

# Description
GiftGenie-React is a web platform that simplifies creating personalised gift cards for any occasion. Users can choose from various designs and add custom messages. With an intuitive interface, GiftGenie makes it easy to create stunning gift cards directly from the web browser, ensuring the perfect present for birthdays, holidays, or special events. This is my second project, which was built on my first project of the same name however, this project was built in React.
# Project Demo




# Usage
Welcome to Gift Genie-React! Busy individuals can generate a perfect gift card for their loved ones. When a user searches for any keyword or theme, my browser would enable them to generate a picture according to their input. They are also able to add a customisable message to the generated card. This convenient way to create personalised cards for any occasion would take the stress out of last-minute shopping and, also allow users a more personalised feel to their cards! I have added more interactive options such as the option to select different fonts and font sizes. User (s) can now add colours of their choosing to their messages, and add different backgrounds as well as different levels of opacity. Using Pexels API, the user(s) now have more than 50 images to choose from once they input a keyword of their choosing. They can navigate the image options using pagination which gives them an option of 8 pages in total.


 * Follow the below steps to generate yourself a gift, get well or a congratulation card(s)!

1. **Search for an image and select your favourite one!**


2. **Now that your favourite image is selected, add a personalised message!**
The position your message section, allows you to move your message on the card until you read your preferred position. You also have the option to change the text on your page to white or leave it in the default colour of black.

3. ** Now select your preferred font, and size and position your message!

4. **You can now view your image + message!**

* You have the option to print (download in your computer then print it) or email it directly to the recipient.
* 
5. **You also have the option to delete your final card! or save it to locale storage**


6. **To start over, all you need to is click on "gift genie - React Logo"  and you'll be taken back to the first page.**
